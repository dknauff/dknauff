A software developer looking to employ his adaptability skills, critical thinking, and desire to learn. After graduating from Butler University, I taught music at the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired and now, through my education in the Eleven Fifty Academy, look to transition into software development!

In my spare time I still listen to, teach, and study music! It will always be a passion of mine. I also enjoy staying active, spending time with friends and family, and trying new recipies!
